# Simplified Snap! Game


Simplified game of "Snap!" between two computer players using N packs of cards (standard 52 card, 4 suit packs).

The "Snap!" matching condition can be the face value of the card, the suit, or both. The program should ask:

(i) 	How many packs to use (i.e. define N)
(ii) 	Which of the three matching conditions to use


### Additional Notes

```
Current version only simulates the game with 1 pack of cards

```

### Test

```
No tests have been provided. 

Suggestion would be using Xunit framework  to perform  all the tests on each method, using 

// arrange section 

// act section 

// assert section 


```
